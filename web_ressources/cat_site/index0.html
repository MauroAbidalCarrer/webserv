<h2>Myow awesome cat website!</h2>

<pre >
    Cats are better than dogs,
That's a fact, not a monologue.
They're independent and quiet,
Their purrs are like music,
While dogs bark and make a riot.

Cats are elegant and sleek,
They clean themselves and don't reek.
Their fur is soft and fluffy,
And they're always quite puffy,
While dogs can be a bit roughy.

Cats are natural hunters,
Mice and rats better run for cover.
They jump and pounce with grace,Cats are better than dogs,
That's a fact, not a monologue.
They're independent and quiet,
Their purrs are like music,
While dogs bark and make a riot.
